  "summary": "A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh",
  "details": "A flaw was found in the key export functionality of libssh. The issue occurs in the internal function responsible for converting cryptographic keys into serialized formats. During error handling, a memory structure is freed but not cleared, leading to a potential double free issue if an additional failure occurs later in the function. This condition may result in heap corruption or application instability in low-memory scenarios, posing a risk to system reliability where key export operations are performed.",
